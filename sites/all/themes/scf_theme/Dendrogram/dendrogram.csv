PKR.Abeta production tau propagation and neurodegeneration are the hallmarks of AD
PKR.Abeta production tau propagation and neurodegeneration are the hallmarks of AD.NIA Alzheimers Association guidelines for the neuropathologic assessment of AD
PKR.PKR is involved in neuroinflammation common to mechanisms of neurodegeneration
PKR.PKR is involved in neuroinflammation common to mechanisms of neurodegeneration.TDP-43 cytoplasmic inclusions present in 20% of AD cases and >80% of ALS cases
PKR.PKR is involved in neuroinflammation common to mechanisms of neurodegeneration.Cytoplasmic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is sufficient to mount a robust type I interferon response within neurons
PKR.PKR is involved in neuroinflammation common to mechanisms of neurodegeneration.Knockout of TDP-43 or loss of function mutations or cytoplasmic inclusions have been shown to de-repress endogenous repeats leading to the production of dsRNA
PKR.PKR is involved in neuroinflammation common to mechanisms of neurodegeneration.PKR senses dsRNA which in turn activates Type I interferon responses and triggers apoptosis
PKR.PKR is involved in neuroinflammation common to mechanisms of neurodegeneration.PKR activated pathways converge with pathways activated by PERK which is activated by ER stress
PKR.PKR is involved in neuroinflammation common to mechanisms of neurodegeneration.PKR protein is elevated in the CSF of patients with AD and ALS and elevated phosphoPKR is associated with accelerated cognitive decline

PKR.PKR activation is linked with ABeta production tau propagation and neurodegeneration.PKR is present at higher levels in the CSF of patients with MCI and AD and predicts cognitive decline
PKR.PKR activation is linked with ABeta production tau propagation and neurodegeneration.PKR is present at higher levels in the CSF of patients with ALS
PKR.PKR activation is linked with ABeta production tau propagation and neurodegeneration.Expression of PKR is significantly elevated in AD brains in the frontal cortex
PKR.PKR activation is linked with ABeta production tau propagation and neurodegeneration.Innate inflammation which induces PKR protein is present in the aging brain and is further increased in AD
PKR.dsRNA activates PKR and neuroinflammation
PKR.dsRNA activates PKR and neuroinflammation.Injection of dsRNA into a rat brain causes persistent inflammation neuronal death and aggregation of APP
PKR.dsRNA activates PKR and neuroinflammation.Genomic instability is prevalent in the aging brain aging is the most significant risk factor for sporadic AD
PKR.dsRNA activates PKR and neuroinflammation.PKR activation induces ABeta production by derepression of BACE1 translation

PKR.Human physiological evidence supports PKR involvement with AD
PKR.Human physiological evidence supports PKR involvement with AD.Expression data shows PKR is significantly up-regulated in brains with SADrelative to the healthy age-matched controls
PKR.Mouse models support dsRNA and PKR involvement with neurodegeneration
PKR.Mouse models support dsRNA and PKR involvement with neurodegeneration.Our two independent models in mice show ds-RNA mediated- neurodegeneration of olfactory sensory neurons with robust induction and activation of PKR
